What is External CSS?
External CSS is a method of applying styles by linking a separate .css file to your HTML document. It is the most efficient and scalable way to style websites.

 Why Use External CSS?
Keeps HTML and CSS separate (cleaner code)

Makes styles reusable across multiple pages

Easier to maintain and update site-wide styles

How It Works
You write your CSS code in a separate file (e.g., style.css) and link it in the HTML file using the <link> tag in the <head> section.

 Linking Syntax in HTML

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
