What is Inheritance in CSS?
Inheritance in CSS means that some properties are automatically passed down from a parent element to its child elements â€” just like traits in a family.

 Key Idea:
If a parent element has a style, certain CSS properties are inherited by its children without needing to redefine them.

 Example:

<div style="color: red;">
  <p>This text is red.</p>
</div>
Even though <p> has no CSS, it inherits the color: red from the parent <div>.
