Introduction to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation (look and feel) of HTML elements on a web page.

 Why CSS?
HTML is used to structure a web page, but it doesn’t define how things look. That’s where CSS comes in — it lets you:

Set colors, fonts, spacing

Create layouts

Add animations

Make responsive designs (work on different screen sizes)
