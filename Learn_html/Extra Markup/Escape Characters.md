Why Use Escape Characters?
Some characters (like <, >, &, ", etc.) are part of HTML syntax. If you want to display them as text, not HTML code, you use escape characters.

Common HTML Escape Characters:
Character	Meaning	Escape Code
<	Less than (used in tags)	&lt;
>	Greater than	&gt;
&	Ampersand	&amp;
Â 	Non-breaking space	&nbsp;

Example in HTML:

<p>5 &lt; 10 and 10 &gt; 5</p>
Output:
5 < 10 and 10 > 5v
